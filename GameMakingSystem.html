                <h3>Project description</h3>
                <p>This project started in 2013 as a business prospect to make simple 2D games for mobile phones.
                    The idea was to be able to produce a lot of games quickly. Those games would differ mostly from the graphics and sounds and would generate revenues thanks to embedded advertisement.
                    Unfortunately that business idea was eventually killed when Apple decided to be more restrictive on the applications it would accept on its app store.
                </p>
                
				<p>The system consists of 2 main components. A game engine and a game editor.</p>
                <p>Once a game is designed, a special tool is used to merge the project file produced by the game editor with the code of the game engine into a Visual Studio solution.
                That solution is then built to produce the game binaries that can be uploaded on the device. The game can run on windows as well which is helpful during developement.</p>

                <p>A first beta version of the system was implemented and supports top view racing games. 
                    The Game Editor is functionnal and game demos were actually running on IPhones.</p>

                <h3>The game engine</h3>                
                <text>The game engine is implemented using the </text><a href ="https://www.monogame.net">MonoGame</a><text> framework.</text>
                <p>It provides components such as physics, game logic, game objects management.</p>
                <h3>The game editor</h3>
                <p>The game editor is implemented with the Silverlight technology. It's an Out Of Browser application (OOB).</p>                
                <p>Thanks to the Silverlight pluggin being available on several platforms, the game editor is a multi-platform application. In particular it can run on Widows and on Mac OS.</p>                
                <text>Some screenshots of the game editor can be found </text>
				<a href ="game-editor.html">here</a>
				<text>.</text>   
                <p>Silverlight being an obsolete technology, the pluggin is not available on recent versions of most web browser.</p> 
                <p>I am now considering a port to WPF which would not be too difficult as Silverlight is based on XAML and is very similar to WPF. But the application would run on Windows only.</p> 
                <p>Another option would be to wait for .Net MAUI to be released.</p>
