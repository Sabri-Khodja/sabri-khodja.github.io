				<text>When I was a kid I was passionate about the first personal computers that were emerging in the 80s. The likes of Comodore 64, Amiga, Atari ST were the focus of my interest at the time. It was then that I had my first shot at programming. Mostly games in basic.</text>
				<br>
				<text>Growing older I obtained an MSC in computer science from a french engineering school</text> 
				<a href="https://www.esiee.fr/en" >(E.S.I.E.E).<a/> 
				<text> in 1998.</text>
				<br>
				<text>I then started my carreer as C/C++ developer working in various industries ranging from telecom to medical imaging and printing industry. During those years I moved to London/UK where I stayed from 2003 to 2011.</text>
				<br>
				<text>From 2010, I switched to C#/.Net. I worked for various organizations mostly in the banking industry. During this time I gained experience working on client/servers systems wich make use of databases and service buses. I also did a lot of UI work using WPF and related libraries.</text>
				<br>
				<text>I am now in the process of moving to my next challenges which are web technologies, micro-services architecture and CLOUD computing. I am currently following online courses on those topics as well as developing personal projects.</text>
